# nz.co.arachnid.simplex

Functional Simplex Implementation in Clojure

 - Max cases implemented. Investigating dual form for min problems.
 
## Todo

 - Get the printer to write out the zj and cj rows.
 - Tests for         
 - Do for equalities and minimisation problems as well.
  

## Done

 - Create slack form of constraints.
 - See if insta parse can go back and forward from the grammar. It can't.
 - Send through a list of strings, one per constraint and then work out the number of variables that would be needed.
